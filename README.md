future:
add a switch button for home and away
order the league table by goal difference
let the delete result page select 2 teams

nice to haves:
form diagram on table
be able to sort table based on one of the columns
filter tables for home and away
list top goalscorers (unlikely)
account/login page to identify who can delete results
add chatgpt for fun lol, ai chatbox

now:
make navbar cover all pages, get them linking up
documentation for all helper functions?

bugs
you can select "select a team" on the away team if a home team has been selected
navbar becomes black when screen is small.
