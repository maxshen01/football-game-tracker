order results by date, currently only ordered by result_id
let the delete result page select 2 teams
add search team function on home page

nice to haves:
form diagram on table
be able to sort table based on one of the columns
filter tables for home and away

account/login page to identify who can delete results
add chatgpt for fun lol, ai chatbox

now:
