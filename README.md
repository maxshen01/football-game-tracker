future:
add a switch button for home and away
order the league table by goal difference
let the delete result page select 2 teams

nice to haves:
form diagram on table
be able to sort table based on one of the columns
filter tables for home and away
list top goalscorers (unlikely)
account/login page to identify who can delete results
add chatgpt for fun lol, ai chatbox

now:
improve delete feature code, to make it more modular
look at creating more helper functions for reusable stuff, e.g. code for alerts maybe
also leading teams code shoud be in helper functions
as well as loading results

bugs
you can select "select a team" on the away team if a home team has been selected
